-------------------Linked List-------------------
    -- Linked List has two main benefits over an array/list
        1. you don't need to pre-allocate space.
        2. Insert is easier.
* It is used to Insert element at the begining of the list - O(1)
* It is used to Delete element at the begining of the list - O(1)
* Linked List Traversal = O(n)
* Accessing element by value = O(n)

* Insert/Delete element at the end -- O(n)


Single Linked List
    * Its refering only next element


Double Linked List
    * Its refering both previous and next element
    * Linked List Traversal is very easy in Double Linked List
