------------------Binary Tree------------------
* Every node has at most two child nodes
* Binary Search Tree or BST
* elements are unique.
* duplicates elements are not allowed in BST.

* Two Approaches 
    - Breadth First Search
    - Depth First Search
        * in order traversal
        * pre order traversal
        * post order traversal


Seach Complexity in BST
    * every iteration we reduce search space by 1/2.
    * n=8       8->4->2->1
    * 3 iterations
    * log2 8 = 3
    * search Complexity = O(log n)

Deleting nodes
    - delete the nodes with no child
    - delete node one child
    - delete node with two children
